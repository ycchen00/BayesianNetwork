<h1 align="center">Welcome to Bayesian Network and Sampling üëã</h1>
<p>
</p>

> Design and build your own Bayesian Network for causal and diagnostic reasoning.  
> Implement Exact Inference and Sanity Checks.  
> Implement Approximate Inference, including rejection sampling and Gibbs sampling, and estimate Convergence and Accuracy.  

## Usage
BayesianNetwork.py: Class of Bayesian Network  
ExactInference.py: Functions of generate exact probability of Bayesian Network  
ApproximateInference.py: Class of sample, including rejection sampling and gibbs sampling methods  
evaluation.py/ipynb: Methods and analysis of convergence and accuracy of two sampling implemented on two networks
