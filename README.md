<h1 align="center">Welcome to Bayesian Network and Sampling 👋</h1>
<p>
</p>

> Design and build your own Bayesian Network for causal and diagnostic reasoning.
> Implement Exact Inference and Sanity Checks.
> Implement Approximate Inference, including rejection sampling and Gibbs sampling, and estimate Convergence and Accuracy.

## Usage
BayesianNetwork.py: Class of Bayesian Network
ExactInference.py: Functions of generate exact probability of Bayesian Network
ApproximateInference.py: Class of sample, including rejection sampling and gibbs sampling methods
evaluation.py/ipynb: Methods and analysis of convergence and accuracy of two sampling implemented on two networks


Run the program：
run evaluation.ipynb
